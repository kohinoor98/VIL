# VIL

Consumers are hard pressed for time and need quick and simple actions to meet their telecom needs. VIL consumer apps gives customers a one-stop solution to manage their VIL account, online bill payments, recharge packs, data packs (2G/3G/4G), data usage and balance, and avail exclusive offers. VIL consumer apps are also used for raising service requests in the form of query, request or complaint.

VIL would like these apps to be more relevant, appealing, and engaging. There are certain highly used features and consumer journeys that we would like to improve and make them best-in-class. Some examples of hero journeys are payment journeys (recharge and bill payments) and VAS service activation/deactivation including Intl roaming services.

Need:

VIL intends to reinvent its consumer apps (My Vodafone App and My Idea App) with the key objective of driving a volume shift of telco users/transactions from offline and 3rd party online to VIL Consumer App.

    The app should be fast, simple, and lite with engaging and design led user journeys for telco products and services.
    The app should have the ability to engage users with non telco offers via a dynamic ecosystem for integrating partnerships (rewards, promotions, subscriptions, payments, etc.,) in a zero friction framework.
    The consumers of the app are multilingual and spread across different socio-economic strata. Hence, vernacular and voice based features should be built to drive adoption and engagement.
    The app can have a loyalty/gaming feature that allows customers to gain rewards by completing tasks.
    The app can have a real/virtual payment system or wallet, with unique propositions to seamless consumer transactions.
